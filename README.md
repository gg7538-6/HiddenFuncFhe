# HiddenFuncFhe

HiddenFuncFhe is a privacy-preserving multi-party computation protocol that leverages Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to enable secure private function evaluation. Multiple parties can collaboratively compute functions over their inputs without revealing either the inputs or the functions themselves, ensuring maximum confidentiality and trust.

## Project Background

In many collaborative settings—such as business partnerships, joint research, or federated analytics—participants need to compute results using private data and proprietary functions. Traditional approaches require either full data disclosure or reliance on trusted intermediaries, creating serious privacy and trust concerns:

- **Input secrecy**: Each participant wants to keep their inputs confidential.  
- **Function secrecy**: Participants may use proprietary or confidential algorithms that must remain hidden.  
- **Trust issues**: Using third-party computation often exposes sensitive business information.  
- **Regulatory compliance**: Sensitive computations may involve data that cannot legally be shared in plaintext.

HiddenFuncFhe addresses these challenges by combining FHE with secure multi-party computation:

- Enables computations on encrypted data without revealing it.  
- Allows functions themselves to remain hidden while being evaluated.  
- Eliminates the need for fully trusted intermediaries.  
- Provides strong guarantees of privacy and data protection for all participants.  

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **Encrypted Input Submission**: Parties submit their data in fully encrypted form.  
- **Hidden Function Evaluation**: Functions can be evaluated in encrypted form, preserving intellectual property.  
- **Collaborative Computation**: Multiple parties jointly compute outputs without revealing sensitive information.  
- **Result Decryption Control**: Only authorized parties can decrypt the final results.  
- **Auditable Computation**: Logs of encrypted operations allow verification without exposing raw data.  

### Privacy & Security

- **FHE-Powered Computation**: Performs arithmetic and logical operations on encrypted data.  
- **Function Privacy**: Even computation logic can remain secret, protecting proprietary methods.  
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All inputs, intermediate computations, and outputs remain encrypted until authorized decryption.  
- **No Trusted Third Party Required**: Eliminates reliance on external parties to maintain confidentiality.  
- **Secure Multi-Party Protocols**: Resistant to collusion attacks and ensures fairness among participants.  

## Architecture
